Hello Wafamde!

This is a test letter. If you want to write a human-like AI, you have to teach it how to understand sentences.
So, let us begin by structuring this letter. Every sentence should contain a message to the AI. It should store some information it got
from them into it's memory. At some point, we might create a database with it's "memory", so it will remember reading this letter.
We also have to teach it the English language or if we are more advanced a language dictionary system.

Lets have at it!
