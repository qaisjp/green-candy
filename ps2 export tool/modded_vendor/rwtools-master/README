This is a heavily modfied library that was originally written by "aap" from GitHub.
I give him credit for establishing this source code as good foundation for RenderWare modding tools.

This library contains new research. It is somewhat compatible to the original library,
but I do not guarrantee that.

The aim of this fork is to provide stable PS2 support. Feel free to look into this.
