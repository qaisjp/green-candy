********** IMG and Stream Limit Adjuster 3.0 **********

This open source ASI plugin adjusts amount of IMG archives possible to load.
By default GTA San Andreas is able to load max of 8 archives (3 standard archives gta3.img, gta_int.img, player.img and 5 archives defined within default.dat or gta.dat)
It`s very inconvenient when making total conversion. More IMG archives means better organization.
Not only IMG limit is hacked - stream limit had to be hacked either.

Now limit is:
MAX_NUMBER_OF_IMG_ARCHIVES = 127;
MAX_NUMBER_OF_STREAM_HANDLES = 400;

It should be sufficient for anyone.

Also it adds support to read IMGLIST file defined within default.dat or gta.dat, like in GTA IV.
For example IMGLIST DATA\IMAGES.TXT

in images.txt:
anim\anim.img
models\paths.img
models\pedprops.img

Works with GTA San Andreas v1.0 [US] HOODLUM No-CD Fixed EXE

***** Installation
- Many users complain it doesn't work with DEP enabled.
  In that case you may have to exclude gta_sa.exe from Data Execution Prevention in Windows. 

- Make sure you are using this version of gta_sa.exe:
	GTA San Andreas v1.0 [US] HOODLUM No-CD Fixed EXE:
	EXE size:  14 383 616 bytes
	
- You need to have ASI loader installed, it is already enabled if you installed CLEO Library.
Otherwise you can download ASI loader from here: http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=8321

- Put ImgLimitAdjuster.asi into GTA San Andreas directory.

- There are two ways to define new archives
  1. Open default.dat or gta.dat. Add entry like this:
  IMG models\weapons.img
  
  2. Open default.dat or gta.dat. Add entry like this:
  IMGLIST DATA\IMAGES.TXT
  
  Create images.txt and put entry:
  models\weapons.img
  
  Commented lines are possible, must begin with # sign.
  For example:
# comment

IMGLIST handling is introduced in IMG Limit Adjuster 1.0, inspired by GTA IV's IMGLIST.
